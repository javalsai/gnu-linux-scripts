# Shell Utils
This are just some scripts made by me to control some basic stuff on GNU+Linux like:
* [Brightness](brightness)
* [Volume](volume)
* [Cpu Usage](cpu-usage)
* [Memory Usage](memory-usage)

Some of them are a bit complex others very simple, but I think that they can be very useful if you are looking for them, I tried to made them work the simplest way possible without requiring some special packages or reading some internal files.
