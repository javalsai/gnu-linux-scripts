# Cpusage
This file just returns the overall cpu usage.

# Configuration
To get the proper value, change the file and replace `12` in `(sum / 12)` with your CPU's number of threads.

# How it works??
It just goes though every process on the system and adds their cpu usage, probably the worst way to do it, but the only that worked for me (if I find the way to do it better I will change this).
